# Screencast

Think about the screencast as a marketing vehicle for your project. Keep it short enough and engaging, be creative. Your goal is to demo your system in the best possible way. 

It will be posted on the [CMPUT 401 portal](https://cmput401.ca/) and [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmKhG9HEMgzaUfdBcyv2nBA), you may use it for your portfolio. 

Upload your screencast to your Google Drive (preferably, in HD) and post the link in your Github repo.
