# Course Outline

## Course Overview

In this course, we review all phases of software development from a process perspective. The course introduces some of the best practices in software product and project management and the architectural and technological impacts on management. Group projects require specification and initial design or redesign of a software system.

## Prerequisites

CMPUT 301, or permission of the instructor.

## Objectives and Learning Outcomes

This course aims to provide students with an authentic experience of working with a client as a team member. We are partnering with the Community Service-Learning Office to create opportunities for you to work on projects identified by community-based organizations as serving their needs. In the process, you will have to apply your knowledge on analyzing requirements, designing, developing, documenting, and testing software, and develop new technical skills working with new programming languages and tools. You will also acquire new knowledge on how to work with others, how to interact with clients to elicit their needs and explain how the delivered software meets these needs, how to negotiate task sharing and manage one’s tasks, how to plan and how to mitigate risks.

## Lecture Schedule and Assigned Readings

The weekly topic schedule is likely to be updated during the term; in general terms, the topics to be covered are:

* Personality and Teamwork
* Software Product Management
* Software Requirements 
* Software Development Process
* Software Architecture
* Estimation and Planning
* Project Management
* User-Interaction Design
* Testing
* Measurement

There is no required textbook for this course. Each module will cite online resources as required readings. You will find the links to each topic on the course eClass page.

## Coursework and Evaluation

### Team Project (70% total)

Your team will deliver the project through an evolutionary process in **five** sprints. All project deliverables will be submitted through the project repository and must be available for inspection by the TAs **by 8 pm two days before the sprint demo** (for example, if your sprint demo is on Monday, you must submit a release on Saturday, no later than 8 pm). Make sure that your release is on GitHub before 8 pm, there will be a penalty for late submissions (the late submission policy is outlined in the Sprint Rubrics document). The team is marked as a whole (left section in the table below), i.e. each team member receives equal marks.

**We may retroactively update your sprint marks based on your _contribution factor_.** It means that your sprint scores may get either higher or lower. The coefficients depend on:

* How your team feels about your contribution to the project (based on the peer feedback forms).
* The instructor and TA's assessment of your individual contribution.

We will review your contribution and apply individual coefficients twice during the term:

1. After Sprint 3 (individual coefficients will be applied to Sprints 1, 2, and 3),
2. After the end of the project (individual coefficients will be applied to Sprints 4 and 5).

### Individual Work (30% total)

Besides the final exam, your individual work component involves:

1. One assignment (due date per class schedule)
2. Reflection forms (four peer-review forms (one after each Sprint) and a final reflection), due by the end of each Sprint demo day (5) and by the end of the class (1)
3. In-class participation

## Participation

Students are expected to attend and participate in all classes and labs, including the class hackathon. Each class may include one or more individual or group exercises. Each lab usually includes a stand-up meeting and may also include other individual or group activities. Missed participation work will not be excused.

## Letter Grades

The conversion of your total numeric coursework score to a final grade will be based on interpreting the guidelines of the descriptors, letter grading system, and four-point scale as defined in Section 23.4 of the University Calendar. That is, grades are assigned on what we judge to be "failure,” "minimal pass,” "poor,” "satisfactory,” "good,” or "excellent" performance in the context of the class. We do not use a particular distribution to do the conversion but instead use our judgment of how your score reflects the mastery of the course material. Typically, you need to be above the median to earn at least a 3.0 or B. Grades are unofficial until approved by the Department and/or Faculty offering the course.

## Deferred Exams

A student who cannot write the final examination due to incapacitating illness, severe domestic affliction or other compelling reasons can apply for a deferred final examination. Such an application must be made to the student's Faculty office within two working days of the missed examination and must be supported by a Statutory Declaration or other appropriate documentation (University Calendar [§23.5.6](http://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/Regulations-and-Information/Academic-Regulation/23.5.html#23.5.6)).

Deferred examinations are a privilege and not a right; there is no guarantee that a deferred examination will be granted. Misrepresentation of facts to gain an excused absence is a breach of the Code of Student Behavior.

See the general GFC rules on [Absence from Exams](http://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/Regulations-and-Information/Academic-Regulation/23.5.html#23.5.6).

## Student Responsibilities

### Academic Integrity

[Code of Student Behaviour](https://www.ualberta.ca/governance/resources/policies-standards-and-codes-of-conduct/code-of-student-behaviour)

The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of academic integrity and honesty. Students are expected to be familiar with these standards regarding academic honesty and to uphold the policies of the University in this respect. Students are particularly urged to familiarize themselves with the provisions of the Code of Student Behaviour (see link above) and avoid any behaviour which could potentially result in suspicions of cheating, plagiarism, misrepresentation of facts and/or participation in an offence. Academic dishonesty is a serious offence and can result in suspension or expulsion from the University.

All forms of academic dishonesty are unacceptable at the University. Any suspected offence will be reported to the Faculty of Science. Anyone who is found in violation of the Code of Student Behaviour may receive a sanction. Typical sanctions include conduct probation, a mark reduction or a mark of 0 on an assessment, a grade reduction or a grade of F in a course, a remark on the transcript, and a recommendation for suspension or expulsion.
