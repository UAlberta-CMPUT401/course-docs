### Sprint planning

* Storymap clearly represents the current state of the project
* Project plan is updated to reflect the current state of the project
* Velocity is re-estimated for Sprint 5
* Sprint 5 tasks are included in the project plan
* Detailed Github Issues for Sprint 5 correspond with the storymap and project plan, have relevant states, milestones, labels and assignees
