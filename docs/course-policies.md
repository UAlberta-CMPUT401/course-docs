# Course Policies

## Team formation policy

### Goal

The goal is to maximize the efficiency of students’ teamwork and, therefore, learning efficiency. To achieve this goal, motivated, balanced, and diverse teams should be formed.

### Criteria

The teams will be formed according to the following criteria:

1. Personal preferences for projects
2. Belbin team roles
3. Career goals diversity
4. Balance of more and less experienced students

Starting Fall 2022, team formation is automated. The algorithm will form teams based on the criteria above. 

Detailed description of the optimization model: [Forming CMPUT 401 Teams as a Mixed Integer-Linear Program](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15PdJFWhm-hsQNjlELNZM3Pyw0ViZv-Pw/view?usp=sharing) _(developed by Dr. Zachary Friggstad)_.

### Process

We will use the following process to form teams:

1. Students fill the Belbin Team Roles Questionnaire (on paper) and calculate their results
2. Students fill the Student Experience Form, indicating, among other questions, their assessed team roles, skills and career goals - link will be posted on eClass
3. Students rank the projects based on their personal preferences - link will be posted on eClass
4. Instructor will assign the students into teams, using the criteria above. The best effort to accommodate students’ preferences will be made. However, we can not guarantee that every student will be assigned to the projects of their top choice.

### Dates

All forms must be submitted no later than **Friday, Sep 9, 11:59 pm**.

Team rosters will be posted on eClass no later than **Monday, Sep 12**.

## Dealing with non-cooperative team members policy

### Recommended steps

If a team member refuses to carry their workload on the project, below are suggested steps.

1. Have a constructive conversation with the uncooperative team member (see details below).
2. If the problem persists, the team should notify their TA by email (with the instructor cc-ed). Based on that, a meetings with the team and/or the uncooperative team member will likely be scheduled.
3. Suppose the team member still refuses to contribute. In that case, the team may notify the uncooperative member by email that they are in danger of being fired. A meeting will be scheduled to discuss what might happen next, including the possibility of firing a non-contributing team member.
4. If there is no subsequent improvement, the team should notify the individual by email (copy to the TA and instructor) that they are no longer with the team.

Firing could have significant consequences. A fired team member might have an option to work alone on an individual project assignment. An individual project is significantly more challenging than a team project because it requires an individual to independently complete the same deliverables. It should be considered as the last chance, not a free pass.  

### Handling constructive conversations with your teammates

We get frustrated about someone not contributing, or we get concerned or anxious about a deadline. It’s to be expected on all projects.

Do we just keep that frustration to ourselves and do extra work, not telling that person?  Does that frustration come out in other ways?  Is it possible that the person is not even aware that s/he is viewed this way? That’s not fair to that person either!  We are not protecting someone from bad news. We could actually be **contributing** to their career downfall. Now’s the time to learn as students, so you don’t have to learn on the job when you have more on the line.

Five steps for a constructive conversation:

1. What I notice and observe
2. What is my concern
3. How I interpret it
4. What it means to me
5. What change I would like to see (request SMART actions: Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, Time-Bound)
 
#### Example of a constructive conversation

_You and your non-contributing teammate Steve._

**You:** I see that you are behind with your project tasks. **(Step 1)**

**Steve:** Yeah, probably I'm a little behind, ...
 
**You:** I'm concerned about that because our next sprint deadline is pretty soon. **(Step 2)**

**Steve:** Oh, I see. I’m also really concerned about it!
 
**You:** Maybe, you've got too much on your plate and are feeling stressed. I just want to check-in.  **(Step 3)**

**Steve:** Yes, I've got so many assignments and readings. I’m very stressed out, ...
 
**You:** This project is really important for me, and I would like to develop a cool app here.  **(Step 4)**

**Steve:** I understand. I would also like to do a good job with this project, ...
 
**You:** Please finish the XYZ module until Friday so that our team has enough time to review the code and finalize deployment.  **(Step 5)**

**Steve:** Sure, I'll do it.
 
Make sure to:

1. Assume positive intent
2. Listen non-judgementally
3. Connect to feelings and concerns
4. Reflect honestly on the intentions and needs involved.
