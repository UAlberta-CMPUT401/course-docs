# Final Presentation

For the final presentation, we will use the PechaKucha format.

Two simple rules for a PechaKucha presentation:

* Exactly 20 slides
* Each slide is displayed for precisely 20 seconds

Total presentation time: 6 min 40 sec.

You **must** use PowerPoint **to set up automatic slide advancement** ([how to set auto advancement](https://wiki.rice.edu/confluence/display/DMCGUIDES/Creating+a+Pecha+Kucha+Presentation+Using+PowerPoint)). Unfortunately, you can’t do it in Google Slides.

You need to upload your PowerPoint presentation to a shared Google Drive folder (see the link on eClass).

### What you might want to talk about

* Project: client and project background
* Team: names, photos, roles in the project, accomplishments
* Experience, ups and downs, what have we learned from this, fun stories about your team
* Technologies that we have used and learned
* Final product: the coolest features, UI and UX solutions
* Feedback from your client and/or users, deployment
