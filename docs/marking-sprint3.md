### UX, UI design

* Product user interface is consistent
* UX (user experience) is well thought-out and designed for the target audience
* UI design principles and usability heuristics are applied and described in the docs (e.g. <https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/>)
* Accessibility is considered and described in the docs (e.g. colors pass contrast check, see <https://www.alarmsystem.no/color-contrast/>)


### Sprint planning

* Storymap clearly represents the current state of the project
* Project plan is updated to reflect the current state of the project
* Velocity is re-estimated for Sprints 4 and 5
* Sprint 4 tasks are included in the project plan
* Detailed Github Issues for Sprint 4 correspond with the storymap and project plan, have relevant states, milestones, labels and assignees
