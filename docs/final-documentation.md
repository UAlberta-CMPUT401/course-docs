# Final Documentation

You will be working on these documents during Sprint 5. They should be separate from the initial documentation. 

## Deployment instructions

The deployment instructions should make it possible for your client to install and run your system on their own servers.

## User manual

The form and format of the user manual should satisfy the needs of the client and user community. Generally, it should be organized by user tasks described step-by-step (not by screen elements, for example).

Remember, that you are developing the user manual for the end users of your system, so think about their socio-cultural profile and level of experience.

## Job description

After this project is over, your client might need to get someone on board to:

1. Install and configure your system;
2. Maintain and update your system, fix accidental bugs;
3. Develop new features.

As a part of the final documentation, you should provide a ready to publish job description. Include all the necessary skills that someone would need to work on your project.
